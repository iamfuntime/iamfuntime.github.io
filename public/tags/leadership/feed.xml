      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;building-high-performance-security-teams-in-2024&#34;&gt;Building High-Performance Security Teams in 2024&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After two decades of building and leading security teams, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that great security doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from tools—it comes from people.
